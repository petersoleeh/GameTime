#### Created by [Peter Maina](https://github.com/petersoleeh) , [David Njoroge](https://github.com/davidnjoroge), [Grantone Mchana](https://github.com/Grantone) and [Khalid Hashi](https://github.com/khalid604)

## Description

This web app will allow users to see the favourite teams in their favourite leagues. When a user is signed up he/she will be able to select all their favourite teams and have them in a favourite section from where they can track the progress of those teams.

The web app will also have the teams standing table per league. This standing table will show all the teams in a league, their position,number of games played,points accrued, and the goal difference. The table arranges the teams in chronological order from the first team to the last team. This is key in allowing the user track his/her teams progress in relation to the other teams in the same league.
